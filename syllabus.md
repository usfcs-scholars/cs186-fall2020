{% include anchor.html h="h2" text="Course Policies" %}

This section includes miscellaneous policies specific to this course. These policies are in addition to the standard USF policies included later.

{% include anchor.html h="h4" text="Evaluation" %}

This project is being funded by the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/) under [Grant No. 1833718](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1833718). As part of grant expectations, an evaluation of project usefulness and impact will be conducted. **All participants are requested to participate in the project evaluation.**

This includes sharing your name and USF email address with [SmartStart Evaluation and Research](http://smartstart-er.com/), which is conducting the external evaluation of this program. They will contact you to participate in one or more surveys.

Please participate. The information you provide to the external evaluators will not impact your grades at the University of San Francisco in any way. These surveys are to evaluate our program (the course) and not you (the student). Your participation will help us both improve and continue this program.

{% include anchor.html h="h4" text="Communication" %}

All course-related communication will be handled using Piazza—a FERPA-compliant Q&A platform that supports public, anonymous, and private posts. When making posts on Piazza, please keep the following in mind:

  - Make a public post when appropriate. You can post anonymously. Your classmates will not be able to see your identity for anonymous posts, but instructors will still be able to see your name. If you make a private post that should be public, you will be asked to create a new public anonymous post before receiving an answer.

  - Make posts specific to you or your grades private to the instructor. This replaces directly emailing the instructor regarding the course. If you email the instructor directly, you will be asked to make a private post on Piazza before receiving an answer.

In addition to Piazza, the instructor will also use Canvas to notify students of missing assignments or warn about low grades. You may also ask for help in-person during office hours or during class time.

{% include anchor.html h="h4" text="Late Policy" %}

Late work is not accepted. Instead, students may request makeup opportunities for missed in-class attendance or participation assignments. No more than 2 requests will be granted per student.

{% include anchor.html h="h4" text="Attendance" %}

Students must attend the weekly seminars and the mandatory community engagement activities outside of class.

Misrepresenting attendance at an outside of class event is a violation of the University's Honor Code. See below for the consequences of honor code violations.

{% include anchor.html h="h4" text="Honor Code Violations" %}

All students are expected to know and adhere to the University's Honor Code (see "Academic Integrity" below). In short, students must never misrepresent their work. Examples of honor code violations include (but are not limited to):

  - Lying about your attendance or participation in outside of class activities

  - Having anyone other than yourself complete your work (including classmates and tutors)

  - Copying and pasting content without attribution from the web (or from anywhere)

<strong class="has-text-danger">Flagrant or repeat violations of the honor code will result in an F in the course, a report to the Academic Integrity Committee (AIC), and a report to the Dean.</strong> At the discretion of the instructor, a less severe penalty may be imposed for minor or first offenses. This is at the sole discretion of the instructor and any violation may result in an F in the course.

{% include anchor.html h="h4" text="Credit Hour Policy" %}

Courses at the University of San Francisco must comply with the [Credit Hour Policy](https://myusf.usfca.edu/sites/default/files/usf_credit_hour_policy_0.pdf), which states:

  > "One unit of credit in lecture, seminar, and discussion work should approximate one hour of direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of-class student work per week through one 15-week semester."

As this is a 2 credit course, students should spend a minimum of 4 hours of work outside of class per week to earn a passing grade. This requirement will be fulfilled via community engagement activities held outside of class time and various participation assignments.

{% include anchor.html h="h4" text="Policy Exceptions" %}

Exceptions to most course policies are made only in the case of verifiable exceptional circumstances. This includes medical emergencies, mental health and well-being crises, or family-related emergencies. Extensions should be arranged prior to the original deadline unless in case of extreme emergency (such as an emergency room visit).

<article class="message">
  <div class="message-body is-size-7">
    <i class="fas fa-plane"></i>&nbsp;
    Have travel plans for a family event (such as a wedding), conference (such as Grace Hopper), or an internship interview? Contact the instructor ahead of time to make arrangements. Keep in mind you will be asked to submit assignments early and make up any missed participation activities. Please note exceptions will not be made for other events (such as concerts, comic cons, and so on).
  </div>

{% include anchor.html h="h2" text="University Policies" %}

This section includes standard statements on University policies and resources.    

{% include anchor.html h="h4" text="Students with Disabilities" %}

If you are a student with a disability or disabling condition, or if you think you may have a disability, please contact [USF Student Disability Services](https://myusf.usfca.edu/sds) (SDS) for information about accommodations.

{% include anchor.html h="h4" text="Behavioral Expectations" %}

All students are expected to behave in accordance with the [Student Conduct Code](https://myusf.usfca.edu/fogcutter) and other University policies.

{% include anchor.html h="h4" text="Academic Integrity" %}

USF upholds the standards of honesty and integrity from all members of the academic community. All students are expected to know and adhere to the University's [Honor Code](https://myusf.usfca.edu/academic-integrity/).

{% include anchor.html h="h4" text="Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)" %}

CAPS provides confidential, free [counseling](https://myusf.usfca.edu/student-health-safety/caps) to student members of our community.
